  s.description      = <<-DESC
    BmoViewPager is a ViewPager with NavigationBar component based on UIPageViewController and UICollectionView, which is a convenience way to supply and manager each viewController.
    I want to make UIPageViewController more intuitive for using it, like UITableView, and supply a navigationBar quickly and simply.
    More importantly, when UIPageViewController scroll continuously, pageControl sometimes will get wrong index, this viewPager can help you solve it.
    There are some standard dataSource and delegate implemented for generating each page and navigationBar, each of these classes  have simple sample code showing in the Pod Example for BmoViewPager.
